The data entered is also saved on a SQL database which can be both created and accessed through the code provided.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

###Prerequisites
JDK:
First thing to download is the Java Development Kit (JDK) this can be found on the oracle website. <br />
-Upon download open the file and you will be promted with the set up page,proceed by clicking next. <br />
-Upon the custom setup page click next. <br />
-Upon the the destination page click next for it to download to its default location [(The JDK will now be installed in C:/Program Files/Java)] if you wish to chech it to install elsewhere please change it accordingly. <br />
-Finally after this you will have succesfully completed installation. Proceed by clicking close. <br />

Set Up:

Next we need to set up the environmental variables for the JDK.

-Press the Windows button and type "path" into the search field, then select "Edit the system environment variables" <br />
-Click Environment Variables. <br />
-From this screen you can edit both the "User" and the "System" variables. You should change the "System" variables (in the bottom half of the window) as we want our changes to affect ALL users. Click New to add a new system variable. <br />
-In the new popup window, we will create our new JAVA_HOME variable and give it a value corresponding to our JDK folder. <br />
-Click Ok and we should now see our new JAVA_HOME system variable in the "System variables" box like so. <br />
-We now need to edit the "Path" variable to include a reference to the /bin (binary files) folder in our JAVA_HOME. <br />
To do this select the "Path" variable under "System variables" and then, click "dit. <br />
-We need to append the path of the Java /bin folder to this "Path" variable. To do this, we will reference the JAVA_HOME variable we created i.e. %JAVA_HOME%\bin <br />
-When you have done this, your "Path" variable should look like the image below (make sure that there is a semi-colon before and after %JAVA_HOME%\bin). <br />

MySQL:
-To download MySQL follow the link (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/8.0.html) and download the link that says mysql-installer-community be sure not the download the one that mentions web. <br />
-Upon the opening the installer you will see a system notifaction box acking you to acceot the changes into your system, click accept to proceed. <br />
-Once the installer window is open choose the set up type as custom and click next. <br />
- Next will be promted to select what software you would like to install: <br />
  -select the newest from MySQL Server from MySQL Server <br />
  -select the newest from MySQL Workbench from application <br />
  -select the newest from Samples and Examples from Documentation <br />
  (Use the green arrow on the side to transfer them from the left to the right). <br />
  -Once these are correctly selected clcik next. <br />
-You should now be on the download page click Execute. <br />

-Swap default editor from VIM to Notepad (this is because the default option Vim has a steep learning curve), then click Next<br />
-Select Override default branch name to "main" then click Next<br />
-Adjust where Git can be run from, selecting Use Git and optional Unix tools from the Command Prompt will allow you to use both Git Bash and command prompt for  version control, you can leave it on default if you'd prefer to only use Git Bash. <br />

SetUp:
-Open Terminal<br />
-(Make sure not to be in a repository, do this by typing git cd)<br />
-Proceed to enter (Replace USERNAME AND EMAIL with your own details. This will be done globally so you wont have to do once you have set this up once on your system.<br />
# git config --global user.name "[USERNAME]" <br />
# git config --global user.email "[EMAIL]" <br />
-If all step are followed your gitbash will be now read to use.


### Installing

-To get the development environment running start of my scrolling to the top of this page and clicking on 'Code'.<br /> 
-There it will take you to the main page and you will see a green button with the label 'Code', Click that. <br />
-Upon clicking a drop down you will be presented with the HTTPS code, Copy that. <br />
